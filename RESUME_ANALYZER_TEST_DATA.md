## Client's Own Words (Interview Preferences)

```
We really need someone who can hit the ground running. Our team is small but mighty - we value people who are self-starters and can work independently. 

We're building AI-powered tools, so experience with machine learning or AI integration would be a huge plus. We're not looking for someone who just knows the tech stack - we need someone who understands the "why" behind architectural decisions.

Culture fit is important. We're a fast-paced startup, so we need people who are adaptable and can handle ambiguity. Someone who's passionate about learning and staying current with technology trends.

We've had issues in the past with developers who couldn't communicate well with non-technical stakeholders. We need someone who can explain technical concepts clearly.

Ideally, they'd have some experience with our specific stack (React, Node, PostgreSQL, AWS), but we're willing to train the right person. What matters most is strong fundamentals and the ability to learn quickly.

Remote work is fine, but we do team meetings twice a week, so timezone overlap with PST is important.
