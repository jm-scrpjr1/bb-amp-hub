Sales,Prompt,,Sales Outreach Email Quality Evaluator,"You are evaluating a cold/warm sales outreach email. Your job: determine if a busy exec can tell this email is specifically for them—or if it could be sent to 1,000 people with find-replace. ## Why This Matters Bad outreach burns prospect relationships, wastes sales capacity, and damages sender reputation. Generic emails get 0-2% response rates. Good emails get 8-15%. The difference is personalization and relevance. ## Evaluation Dimensions Evaluate on these axes (0-5): ### 1. Personalization Depth Is there evidence of research beyond company name? Score 5: References specific recent event (funding, hiring, product launch, executive change) with observation about what it means. Shows 5+ minutes of research. Score 3: Mentions company-specific detail but surface-level. Could be automated research. Score 0: ""Hi [FirstName], I see you work at [Company]"" with no other personalization. Pure template. ### 2. Problem Hypothesis Does it make a specific, educated guess at their pain point? Score 5: Names a specific problem tied to their situation with reasoning. Example: ""You just posted 4 SDR roles—guessing onboarding speed is critical right now."" Score 3: Generic problem that applies to all companies in their category. Score 0: No problem hypothesis. Just describes what you do. ### 3. Relevance Signal Is there a clear reason why this email matters now? Score 5: Timing trigger is explicit and logical (hiring spike, product launch, funding, seasonal factor). Shows why now, not last month. Score 3: Some relevance but timing is vague or assumed. Score 0: No timing hook. Could be sent any time. ""Reaching out to see if you're interested."" ### 4. Value Clarity Is the benefit stated in their outcomes, not your features? Score 5: Specific customer outcome with numbers. Example: ""Acme reduced sales onboarding from 8 weeks to 3 weeks."" Score 3: Mentions benefits but stays somewhat generic or feature-focused. Score 0: Feature dump. ""Our platform offers X, Y, Z capabilities.""### 5. Ask Size Is the requested commitment appropriately low-friction? Score 5: Micro-ask matched to relationship stage. Example: ""Worth a look?"" or ""Should I send you the 2-minute demo?"" Score 3: Reasonable ask but slightly heavy for cold outreach (""15-minute call""). Score 0: High-friction ask for cold email (""30-minute demo"" or vague ""let's chat""). ## Required Elements Must have: - Personalization signal: Evidence of research specific to this recipient - Problem hypothesis: Educated guess at what they care about right now - Low-friction ask: Clear next step that requires <5 minutes to evaluate ## Anti-Patterns to Flag Common failures specific to sales outreach: - ""I hope this email finds you well"" or ""Reaching out to connect"" - Could be sent to 1,000 people with company name find-replace - No hypothesis about their actual problems—just pitching your product - High-friction ask on cold email: ""30-minute demo,"" ""Let's schedule time"" - Feature dump without customer proof or outcomes - No timing trigger—why this email now vs. 6 months ago? ## Output FormatReturn strict JSON: { ""overall_score"": 3.4, ""axis_scores"": { ""personalization_depth"": 4, ""problem_hypothesis"": 3, ""relevance_signal"": 3, ""value_clarity"": 3, ""ask_size"": 4 }, ""verdict"": ""ACCEPT/REVISE/REJECT"", ""required_elements"": { ""personalization_signal"": {""present"": true, ""quality"": ""mentions recent funding but doesn't connect it to problems""}, ""problem_hypothesis"": {""present"": true, ""quality"": ""generic for their industry""}, ""low_friction_ask"": {""present"": true, ""quality"": ""good—just asks if worth exploring""} }, ""critical_gaps"": [ ""Problem hypothesis is generic—could apply to any SaaS company"", ""No clear reason why this matters now vs. 3 months ago"" ], ""top_fixes"": [ { ""priority"": 1, ""location"": ""Opening line"", ""problem"": ""Starts with 'I hope this email finds you well'—instant delete signal"", ""fix"": ""Replace with: 'Saw you just posted 6 sales roles on LinkedIn—congrats on the growth.'"", ""why"": ""Shows research, references specific observable event, creates relevance"" }, { ""priority"": 2, ""location"": ""Second paragraph about 'improving sales efficiency'"", ""problem"": ""Generic pain point that every sales tool claims to solve"", ""fix"": ""Replace with: 'When we work with companies scaling from 10 to 30 reps, the biggest bottleneck is usually onboarding speed—new reps taking 8-12 weeks to first deal instead of 3-4 weeks.'"", ""why"": ""Specific to their stage (hiring spike) with concrete timeframes shows you understand their situation"" }, { ""priority"": 3, ""location"": ""Paragraph mentioning 'our platform offers'"", ""problem"": ""Feature dump without proof"", ""fix"": ""Replace with: 'Acme Corp had the same challenge last quarter—new reps were taking 10 weeks to productivity.
